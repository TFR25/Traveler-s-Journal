# Traveler's Journal
### Android Travel Journal - COM 437 Term project

### Project Description
- The intent of this project is to create a travel journal app for Android. 

- The app will have an area that displays a calendar to allow users to input travel dates. Then, it will generate a calendar that the user can click on. This action will take them to a page where they can journal about their dayâ€™s experience and add photos to accompany their journal entry. 

- Ultimately, I would like each entry to have the ability to share on social media. 

- Another feature I would like to incorporate would be the ability to export to a format that could be printed as a book.
